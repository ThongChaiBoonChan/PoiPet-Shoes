The radiance lives on in the Nike Force 1 Premium. Crossing hardwood comfort with off-court flair, this hoops original puts a fresh spin on the AF1. Bold details and era-echoing â€˜80s construction help deliver nothing-but-net style while soft foam along the collar and tongue keep little feet comfy.
