These adidas running shoes take it back to the '90s. At the same time, they go full speed into the future. The thick design lines and sturdy outsole are well-matched by the soft Cloudfoam midsole, which adds springiness to your run. The classic sporty shape is elevated by the upper's rich mix of materials. Go high. Go low. Go everywhere in these sneakers.

Made with a series of recycled materials, this upper features at least 50% recycled content. This product represents just one of our solutions to help end plastic waste.
