THE AUTHENTIC LOW TOP WITH THE SHELL TOE.
Originally made for basketball courts in the '70s. Celebrated by hip hop royalty in the '80s. The adidas Superstar shoe is now a lifestyle staple for streetwear enthusiasts. The world-famous shell toe feature remains, providing style and protection. Just like it did on the B-ball courts back in the day. Now, whether at a festival or walking in the street you can enjoy yourself without the fear of being stepped on. The serrated 3-Stripes detail and adidas Superstar box logo adds OG authenticity to your look.
