ADIDAS X LEGO® BRAND PARTNERSHIP SHOES MADE IN PART WITH RECYCLED MATERIALS
Every day the sun rises is a chance to create and play. So if you're ready to get started — go ahead and step out in these adidas Superstar shoes. Made in collaboration with the LEGO Group, they celebrate big dreams, creative self-expression and of course, LEGO® bricks. Colourful lace jewels that look just like little flowers decorate the clean upper, while the shell toe and 3-Stripes look iconic like the '70s original.

Made with a series of recycled materials, this upper features at least 50% recycled content. This product represents just one of our solutions to help end plastic waste.
