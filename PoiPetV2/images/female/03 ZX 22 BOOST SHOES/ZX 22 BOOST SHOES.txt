RUNNING-INSPIRED SHOES MADE IN PART WITH RECYCLED CONTENT.
Taking design cues from the adidas ZX, the ZX 22 BOOST was born through the use of virtual and augmented reality. These shoes are future-thinking, boundary-pushing tools of expression while still remaining true to their running roots. The JET BOOST midsole gives you responsive energy, so you can explore what the day has in store for you one plush step at a time.


Made in part with recycled content generated from production waste, e.g. cutting scraps, and post-consumer household waste to avoid the larger environmental impact of producing virgin content.
